# Organizer
This is my first big project created in JavaScript and jQuery mainly.
 
## Description
The project consists of three parts: Calendar, Contacts and To-Do List. Data, that can be modified, are stored online on server in text files. You can add, edit or remove events in Calendar. Also you can add, edit or remove contacts. On To-Do List you can create new tasks, set priority, check when it's done or remove it.
While reviewing the project, you' ll notice that everyone can make changes. Iâ€™m fully aware of this lack of security, but also as a demo version, it's easier to explore in the current form. Everything was coded by myself, no external plug-in was used.
